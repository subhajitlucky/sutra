🕉 I built a programming language for AI agents.

Not another API wrapper. Not another JSON protocol. A proper language — with grammar, parser, interpreter, cryptographic signatures, and multi-agent runtime.

It's called **SUTRA** (Structured Universal Transaction & Reasoning Architecture).

8 keywords. Sanskrit-inspired ontology. English-readable syntax.

```
INTENT buy(item="SmartTV", max_price=50000);
QUERY available(item="SmartTV") FROM "seller@store";
OFFER id="deal-001" TO "seller@store" {
    give: {money: 48000},
    want: {item: "SmartTV", brand: "LG"}
};
COMMIT pay(amount=48000, to="seller@store") BY "2026-03-02";
```

Why?

Today's AI agents talk in unstructured English (ambiguous) or rigid JSON (no semantic meaning). Neither works for autonomous negotiation.

SUTRA sits in between — formal, deterministic, auditable, and human-readable.

What it does:
→ Agents declare **intentions** (Sankalpa)
→ Share **verified knowledge** (Pramana)  
→ **Negotiate** offers with accept/reject/counter
→ **Commit** to cryptographically signed obligations (Dharma)
→ Auto-respond to queries, auto-evaluate offers
→ Full conversation transcripts with message threading

The stack (pure Python, zero required deps):
• v0.1 — Lexer → Parser → AST → Interpreter → Agent model
• v0.2 — HTTP transport (agents communicate over network)
• v0.3 — Ed25519 cryptographic signatures
• v0.4 — Multi-agent runtime (agents talk in-process)

The origin story: I ran a cross-model experiment — Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, Grok, and Kimi each designed their ideal agent communication protocol. Then I analyzed all five, found the universal consensus, and distilled it into SUTRA.

The Sanskrit roots aren't decoration — they're structural ontology. COMMIT maps to Dharma (duty). FACT maps to Pramana (valid knowledge). These aren't metaphors, they're precise philosophical concepts that have been formalized for millennia.

If you're building multi-agent systems — try SUTRA. Your agents deserve a real language.
